                        <h3>Dietary Needs and Restrictions</h3>
                        <p>Unlike rabbits, guinea pigs cannot synthesize Vitamin C so they have to get it from their diet. The majority of packaged guinea pig foods, such as pellets, contain the required amounts of Vitamin C in their recipes. Fresh foods can also be a good source, if your piggies like to eat them. Mine prefer Bok Choy and Romaine lettuce, but many guinea pigs also like a good bell pepper.</p>

                    <!--HABITAT-->
                    <div id="habitat">
                        <h3>Habitat and Cleanliness</h3>
                        <p>It is very important to your pet's health that you keep their cage and other living areas clean. An easy option to care for are fleece mats to line the bottom of the cage, as these are machine washable. But piggies like to dig down into soft materials for comfort, so I recommend also including an area with wood shavings or another type of loose bedding.</p>
                    </div>
                    <!--SOCIAL-->
                    <div id="social">
                        <h3>Play and Social Needs</h3>
                        <p>In the wild, guinea pigs live in family groups of up to ten adults. The social aspect of their life is very important for their wellbeing and so it is recommended to keep pet guinea pigs in pairs or trios. But be careful! Should you have a male and a female that are unaltered, babies are likely to ensue pretty quickly.</p>
